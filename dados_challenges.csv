""The need to balance short lead times and elevated quality levels requires the adoption of appropriate approaches that should be integrated into companies' best practices"" (Fani et al., 2023).
Companies struggle with defining sample sizes for quality control, as static parameters are not suitable for fast-changing environments.

""The huge amount of data collected even by low-tech companies through I4.0 solutions to trace quality control outcomes remains quite often non-used, leading to the ‘rich data but poor information’ issue"" (Fani et al., 2023).

Technological
Heavy investment in infrastructure:
“Despite SMEs’ financial constraints, BC adoption needs heavy investment in software and infrastructure, as insufficient infrastructure leads to failure in implementation.”

Complexity:
“BC is more complicated than traditional systems, and the internal knowledge of firms should be improved.”

Security challenge:
“Though security is one of the promising characteristics of BC in SCM, it is also a source of uncertainty because of security challenges related to privacy concerns, the trade-off between security and performance, cybersecurity issues, and threats.”

Scalability:
“Scalability is a technical challenge for SCMs. However, according to the expected transactions’ speed, volume, and tolerated confirmation, latency could act as a determinant for SMEs to use public or private BC.”

Non-admission of technology:
“There are various reasons for hesitation in acceptance BC by different stakeholders | Accessibility of technology: 
the Internet bandwidth, IT infrastructure, and basic knowledge about the technology make it hardly accessible, especially for SMEs which are generally deprived of these items.

The negative  perception toward BC:
Immaturity and security challenges impose negative perceptions toward BC technology.

Immutability challenge: 
Immutability is a two-sided feature of BC. If an SME seeks a more flexible system toward human errors, BC is not a good choice.

Immaturity""
Immaturity of BC refers to challenges like scalability, interoperability,
latency, usability, storage large size of blocks, and dealing with a large
number of transactions. | nan | nan"
