ID 10: TOE Dimensions - Barriers and Explanations

Technological
Heavy investment in infrastructure:
“Despite SMEs’ financial constraints, BC adoption needs heavy investment in software and infrastructure, as insufficient infrastructure leads to failure in implementation.”

Complexity:
“BC is more complicated than traditional systems, and the internal knowledge of firms should be improved.”

Security challenge:
“Though security is one of the promising characteristics of BC in SCM, it is also a source of uncertainty because of security challenges related to privacy concerns, the trade-off between security and performance, cybersecurity issues, and threats.”

Scalability:
“Scalability is a technical challenge for SCMs. However, according to the expected transactions’ speed, volume, and tolerated confirmation, latency could act as a determinant for SMEs to use public or private BC.”

Non-admission of technology:
“There are various reasons for hesitation in acceptance BC by different stakeholders
ID 12: Technology: ""Not enough data in social media to take advantage of Big Data analytics.""
""There is no presence of local suppliers’ databases, so it is impossible to use Big Data analytics in procurement and lack of information sharing with the public regarding technologies.""
""Specific technologies are not reliable for the agricultural industry, like IoT and drones, are not reliable for soil moisture testing."" 
""Internet services are not reliable, so it is not possible to use the Cloud, and the internet providers do not receive penalties for poor services.""

Economic: ""The economy is protected as there is not much competition or entrance of disruptive technology that causes companies to upgrade their technologies.""
""It is very costly to implement a cloud because of the technological infrastructure required. Issues in accessing foreign resources, whether they are technologies or knowledge, particularly financial transactions, are an issue. Thus, it is hard to use, for

ID 34: Lack of collaboration:
""Several respondents (90%) perceived that the lack of SC collaboration is a critical barrier to implement supply chain 4.0. In this view, five respondents, including a food and beverage manufacturer, a farmer, a packaging firm and two retailers lamented that each firm in the SC works for its individual interest and accomplishment of performance objectives. Such fragmentation in SC, where most firms have conflicting goals, could preclude availability of resources and capabilities needed to implement supply chain 4.0.""

Organizational inertia:
""Organisation inertia, such as resistance to change, lack of motivation, skills and strategic commitment, appeared the second critical barrier to implement supply chain 4.0. Four respondents including a manufacturer, a processor and a farmer believed that the underlying reasons for current organisational inertia are fear among the staff about job loss, lack of trust and being connected to old work style.""

Heavy investment in infrastructure:
“Despite SMEs’ financial constraints, BC adoption needs heavy investment in software and infrastructure, as insufficient infrastructure leads to failure in implementation.”

Complexity:
“BC is more complicated than traditional systems, and the internal knowledge of firms should be improved.”

Security challenge:
“Though security is one of the promising characteristics of BC in SCM, it is also a source of uncertainty because of security challenges related to privacy concerns, the trade-off between security and performance, cybersecurity issues, and threats.”

Scalability:
“Scalability is a technical challenge for SCMs. However, according to the expected transactions’ speed, volume, and tolerated confirmation, latency could act as a determinant for SMEs to use public or private BC.”

Non-admission of technology:
“There are various reasons for hesitation in acceptance BC by different stakeholders

Heavy investment in infrastructure:
“Despite SMEs’ financial constraints, BC adoption needs heavy investment in software and infrastructure, as insufficient infrastructure leads to failure in implementation.”

Complexity:
“BC is more complicated than traditional systems, and the internal knowledge of firms should be improved.”

Security challenge:
“Though security is one of the promising characteristics of BC in SCM, it is also a source of uncertainty because of security challenges related to privacy concerns, the trade-off between security and performance, cybersecurity issues, and threats.”

Scalability:
“Scalability is a technical challenge for SCMs. However, according to the expected transactions’ speed, volume, and tolerated confirmation, latency could act as a determinant for SMEs to use public or private BC.”

Non-admission of technology:
“There are various reasons for hesitation in acceptance BC by different stakeholders

Heavy investment in infrastructure:
“Despite SMEs’ financial constraints, BC adoption needs heavy investment in software and infrastructure, as insufficient infrastructure leads to failure in implementation.”

Complexity:
“BC is more complicated than traditional systems, and the internal knowledge of firms should be improved.”

Security challenge:
“Though security is one of the promising characteristics of BC in SCM, it is also a source of uncertainty because of security challenges related to privacy concerns, the trade-off between security and performance, cybersecurity issues, and threats.”

Scalability:
“Scalability is a technical challenge for SCMs. However, according to the expected transactions’ speed, volume, and tolerated confirmation, latency could act as a determinant for SMEs to use public or private BC.”

Non-admission of technology:
“There are various reasons for hesitation in acceptance BC by different stakeholders

“Though security is one of the promising characteristics of BC in SCM, it is also a source of uncertainty because of security challenges related to privacy concerns, the trade-off between security and performance, cybersecurity issues, and threats.”

Scalability:
“Scalability is a technical challenge for SCMs. However, according to the expected transactions’ speed, volume, and tolerated confirmation, latency could act as a determinant for SMEs to use public or private BC.”

Heavy investment in infrastructure:
“Despite SMEs’ financial constraints, BC adoption needs heavy investment in software and infrastructure, as insufficient infrastructure leads to failure in implementation.”

Complexity:
“BC is more complicated than traditional systems, and the internal knowledge of firms should be improved.”

Security challenge:
“Though security is one of the promising characteristics of BC in SCM, it is also a source of uncertainty because of security challenges related to privacy concerns, the trade-off between security and performance, cybersecurity issues, and threats.”

Scalability:
“Scalability is a technical challenge for SCMs. However, according to the expected transactions’ speed, volume, and tolerated confirmation, latency could act as a determinant for SMEs to use public or private BC.”

Non-admission of technology:
“There are various reasons for hesitation in acceptance BC by different stakeholders

Employment disruptions (B17): 
This is defined as the unrest in the employment owing to the adoption of emerging technologies that demand the need for learning and
automation of process.
Lack of green initiatives (B18): 
Minimum usage of packaging material reduces material handling and transportation costs. The industry is responsible for providing waste collection and other processing facilities, which if not handled carefully can harm environment conditions.
ID 22: Legal and contractual uncertainty (B19): 
Questions related to legal ownership of the process and the legal responsibility for inaccuracies with manufacturing need to be resolved appropriately.
Regulatory compliance (B20):
Data from various sources are captured using different devices, which makes the data vulnerable to attacks and needs intervention from legal experts.
Economic High implementation cost (B21):
This encompasses all costs including procurement of technological installations, mechanical equipment, and engineering services. It also includes cost related to labour and  aintenance
costs for the equipment maintenance. The investors must consider the investment costs, which is the widely used economic criteria to assess sustainable practices in any industry/
sector.

ID 34: Lack of collaboration:
""Several respondents (90%) perceived that the lack of SC collaboration is a critical barrier to implement supply chain 4.0. In this view, five respondents, including a food and beverage manufacturer, a farmer, a packaging firm and two retailers lamented that each firm in the SC works for its individual interest and accomplishment of performance objectives. Such fragmentation in SC, where most firms have conflicting goals, could preclude availability of resources and capabilities needed to implement supply chain 4.0.""

Organizational inertia:
""Organisation inertia, such as resistance to change, lack of motivation, skills and strategic commitment, appeared the second critical barrier to implement supply chain 4.0. Four respondents including a manufacturer, a processor and a farmer believed that the underlying reasons for current organisational inertia are fear among the staff about job loss, lack of trust and being connected to old work style.""

""The need to balance short lead times and elevated quality levels requires the adoption of appropriate approaches that should be integrated into companies' best practices"" (Fani et al., 2023).
Companies struggle with defining sample sizes for quality control, as static parameters are not suitable for fast-changing environments.
Data Utilization in Low-Tech Sectors:

""The huge amount of data collected even by low-tech companies through I4.0 solutions to trace quality control outcomes remains quite often non-used, leading to the ‘rich data but poor information’ issue"" (Fani et al., 2023).
Traditional quality control relies on fixed parameters, which do not adapt well to dynamic production environments.

Heavy investment in infrastructure:
“Despite SMEs’ financial constraints, BC adoption needs heavy investment in software and infrastructure, as insufficient infrastructure leads to failure in implementation.”

Complexity:
“BC is more complicated than traditional systems, and the internal knowledge of firms should be improved.”

Security challenge:
“Though security is one of the promising characteristics of BC in SCM, it is also a source of uncertainty because of security challenges related to privacy concerns, the trade-off between security and performance, cybersecurity issues, and threats.”

Scalability:
“Scalability is a technical challenge for SCMs. However, according to the expected transactions’ speed, volume, and tolerated confirmation, latency could act as a determinant for SMEs to use public or private BC.”

Technological
Heavy investment in infrastructure:
“Despite SMEs’ financial constraints, BC adoption needs heavy investment in software and infrastructure, as insufficient infrastructure leads to failure in implementation.”

Complexity:
“BC is more complicated than traditional systems, and the internal knowledge of firms should be improved.”

Security challenge:
“Though security is one of the promising characteristics of BC in SCM, it is also a source of uncertainty because of security challenges related to privacy concerns, the trade-off between security and performance, cybersecurity issues, and threats.”

Scalability:
“Scalability is a technical challenge for SCMs. However, according to the expected transactions’ speed, volume, and tolerated confirmation, latency could act as a determinant for SMEs to use public or private BC.”

Non-admission of technology:
“There are various reasons for hesitation in acceptance BC by different stakeholders
ID 12: Technology: ""Not enough data in social media to take advantage of Big Data analytics.""
""There is no presence of local suppliers’ databases, so it is impossible to use Big Data analytics in procurement and lack of information sharing with the public regarding technologies.""
""Specific technologies are not reliable for the agricultural industry, like IoT and drones, are not reliable for soil moisture testing."" 
""Internet services are not reliable, so it is not possible to use the Cloud, and the internet providers do not receive penalties for poor services.""

Economic: ""The economy is protected as there is not much competition or entrance of disruptive technology that causes companies to upgrade their technologies.""
""It is very costly to implement a cloud because of the technological infrastructure required. Issues in accessing foreign resources, whether they are technologies or knowledge, particularly financial transactions, are an issue. Thus, it is hard to use, for

Heavy investment in infrastructure:
“Despite SMEs’ financial constraints, BC adoption needs heavy investment in software and infrastructure, as insufficient infrastructure leads to failure in implementation.”

Complexity:
“BC is more complicated than traditional systems, and the internal knowledge of firms should be improved.”

Security challenge:
“Though security is one of the promising characteristics of BC in SCM, it is also a source of uncertainty because of security challenges related to privacy concerns, the trade-off between security and performance, cybersecurity issues, and threats.”

Scalability:
“Scalability is a technical challenge for SCMs. However, according to the expected transactions’ speed, volume, and tolerated confirmation, latency could act as a determinant for SMEs to use public or private BC.”
